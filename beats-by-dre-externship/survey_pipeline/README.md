## Wireless Speaker Market Research – Beats by Dre
# Executive Summary

I analyzed survey data from over 4,900 respondents to help Beats decide whether to launch a new high-fidelity wireless speaker.
The data suggests a GO decision if:
- Pricing stays between $129–$199
- Battery life lasts 15+ hours
Beats already has strong brand trust, but buyers make their decisions mainly on price and battery performance. My recommendation: emphasize sound quality and Apple ecosystem strengths while improving battery life and keeping pricing sharp.
