Top Correlation Pairs,Correlation (r),Interpretation,,,
[Sound quality] vs. [Design/Looks],-0.542,Moderate negative correlation,Consumers tend to trade off functions or aesthetics because consumers that value sound quality tend to deprioritize design/looks.,,
[Sound quality] vs. [Battery life],0.435,Moderate positive correlation,Consumers that value performance expect both a long battery life and good sound quality.,,
[Battery life] vs. [Price],-0.434,Moderate negative correlation,Consumers that are price sensitive/on a budget trade off premium features (like long battery life) for a better price.,,
[Sound quality] vs. [Durability],-0.423,Moderate negative correlation,Consumers that prioritize sound deprioritize durability. Divided based on needs between indoor users and outdoor/practical users.,,
[Connectivity] vs. [Likelihood to buy],0.007,None/very weak correlation,"Connectiviy does not affect purchase intent meaning that the feature is an expectation, not a driver.",,
Additional correlation insights,,,,,
68% of heavy users (daily to several times a week) and 42% of light users (once a week or less) rated battery life as extremely important (ranked 5),,,,,
"72% of high spenders ($200 or more) prioritize sound quality, leaving it in their top 2 consistently. As opposed to 45% in the $50 or less group.",,,,,

Segmentation Type,Label,Category,Count,Percentage,Interpretation
Age & Income,Young & Low-income,Age (18-24),1100,23,
,,"Income (Less than $25,000)",,,More budget conscious and concerned about price over features like durability
,Young & Mid-income,Age (18-24),,,"Still early in their carerr but have more disposable income, leading to less of a price bias. More balanced preferences. Place imporatance on sound quality and battery life, in addition to price."
,,"Income ($25,000-$75,000)",800,16,
,Older & Higher-income,Age(25+),,,Well into careers and are established financially. Tend to value features like durability and connectivity more. 
,,"Income($75,000)",600,12,
,,,,,Dataset leans toward a young demographic that are have low-mid income. Slight bias towards features that offer affordability and portability.
