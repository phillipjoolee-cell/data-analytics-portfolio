# Analysis  

This folder contains the survey analysis files.  

- Quantitative Analysis: breakdowns by demographics, ownership, purchase intent, feature priorities, and spending behavior.  
- Qualitative Analysis: themes from open-ended responses, grouped into what people like vs. where Beats falls short.  
- Complete Analysis: a combined file pulling together both quantitative and qualitative findings.
