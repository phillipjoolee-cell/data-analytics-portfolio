# Data

This folder has all the data I used and created in the pipeline.  
I split it up so you can see how it flows from start to finish:

- **raw/** – the original scraped reviews straight from OxyLabs (untouched).  
- **interim/** – the middle steps: cleaned with Pandas, prepped with NumPy, and EDA outputs.  
- **processed/** – the final deliverables: Excel dashboards, correlation matrices, sentiment analysis results, and Gemini AI review insights.  
- **figures/** – all the PNG charts that get dropped along the way and used in the README.
