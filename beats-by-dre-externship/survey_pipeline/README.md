# Wireless Speaker Market Research – Beats by Dre  

## Executive Summary  
I analyzed survey data from over 4,900 respondents to help Beats decide whether to launch a new high-fidelity wireless speaker.  
The results point to a **GO decision** if:  
- Pricing stays in the **$129–$199** range  
- Battery life lasts **15+ hours**  

Beats already has strong brand trust, but buyers make their decisions mainly on **price and battery life**. My recommendation: lean on sound quality and Apple ecosystem strengths while fixing battery gaps and keeping pricing sharp.  

## What I Did  
- Cleaned and structured the survey dataset  
- Ran quantitative analysis (demographics, ownership, purchase intent, feature priorities, spending behavior)  
- Ran qualitative analysis (themes from open-ended responses)  
- Built deliverables in Excel, PDF, and as an interactive dashboard  

## Key Findings  
- Market is crowded: JBL leads mid-range, Bose leads premium  
- Price and battery are the main deal-breakers  
- Sweet spot is **$129–$179**, covering ~60% of consumers  
- Core audience: younger, brand-aware, price-sensitive buyers  

## Deliverables  
- Cleaned Excel dataset  
- Quantitative + qualitative analysis workbooks  
- Executive PDF presentation  
- Interactive dashboard
