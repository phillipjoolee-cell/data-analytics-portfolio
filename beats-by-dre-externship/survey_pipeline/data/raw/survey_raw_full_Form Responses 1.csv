The speaker positioned in our bathroom does not sound very good, it is an Ortisan X10 speaker and the best way I can describe its sound quality is that it is like a five below speaker but louder and with a bit more bass. It also happens to have two drivers instead of the traditional single driver set up found in most five below speakers which gives it stereo sound and it also has stereo pairing and lights, along with three EQs which do change the sound but don't make it sound much better, and no customizable EQ. I also use a Bose Soundlink Micro speaker speaker. The speaker struggles to hit low base notes but otherwise sounds good.

2024-09-16 20:35:18.656,thuraniravitalis@gmail.com,Yes,Several times a week,Good,"When evaluating the sound quality of a wireless speaker, several key factors are typically considered:

1. Clarity and Detail: High-quality speakers reproduce audio with clarity, allowing you to hear distinct instruments and vocals without muddiness.

2. Bass Response. A good wireless speaker should provide a balanced bass response without overpowering the mids and highs. Deep, rich bass enhances the listening experience.

3. Volume Range: The speaker should perform well at various volume levels, maintaining sound quality even at higher volumes without distortion.

4. Stereo Imaging: Stereo separation creates a sense of space and directionality, making music feel more immersive.

5. Frequency Range. A wider frequency range enables the speaker to reproduce a broader spectrum of sounds, from deep lows to crisp highs.

6. Connectivity: While not directly related to sound quality, stable Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections ensure that audio playback is consistent and free of interruptions.

7. Build Quality: The materials used in the speaker can also affect sound quality. Well-constructed speakers tend to have better resonance and less unwanted vibration.",3.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,JBL,"3 (Important, but not a deal breaker)",5 (Very Important),4,4,4,"3 (Important, but not a deal breaker)","3 (Important, but not a deal breaker)",3.0,Longer battery life.,"Listening to music, Watching movies/TV shows","Working from home more, More media consumption (music, movies, games), More online social interactions",$200 to $300,3.0,Multi-brand electronics stores (an actual physical store selling ONLY electronics from a variety of brands),"When evaluating the price of a wireless speaker, several factors come into play:

1. Sound Quality: Assess whether the audio performance justifies the cost. Higher-priced models often offer better clarity, bass response, and overall fidelity.

2. Brand Reputation: Established brands may command higher prices due to their reliability, warranty, and customer service. Researching brand reviews can provide insight into value.

3. Features and Technology.Consider the features included, such as Bluetooth range, multi-room capability, voice assistant integration, and battery life. More features typically correlate with a higher price.

4. Build Quality: Durable materials and construction can add to the cost. A well-built speaker may last longer and perform better, making it a worthwhile investment.

5. Portability: If the speaker is designed for mobility (lightweight, compact, and with a good battery), it may justify a higher price due to convenience.",25-34,Male,"$25,000-$50,000",Questionnaire should be brief.,0.0

2024-09-17 13:38:46.774,mariamishimwe15@gmail.com,Yes,Daily,Excellent,"When rating the sound quality of a wireless speaker, I focus on several key aspects. First, clarity is crucial—whether the speaker delivers crisp, detailed sound without distortion, even at high volumes. I pay attention to the balance between bass, mids, and treble; a good speaker should produce deep, punchy bass while maintaining clear mids and highs for vocals and instruments. Another important factor is the stereo separation and whether the speaker offers a wide, immersive soundstage or feels flat and narrow. I also evaluate the volume output, ensuring the speaker can get loud enough without losing sound fidelity, and the distortion levels, especially at higher volumes. Finally, if the speaker supports EQ customization or has specific sound modes, I consider how well these adjust the sound to different listening preferences. A high-quality speaker should excel in these areas, providing a rich and balanced audio experience.",4.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,Samsung,4,1 (Not Important),5 (Very Important),4,"3 (Important, but not a deal breaker)",2,5 (Very Important),5.0,"To make my wireless speaker better, I’d like to see a few key improvements. First, enhanced bass performance would add more depth, especially for low-frequency sounds, without overpowering the mids and highs. Longer battery life would also be a great upgrade, allowing for extended use without frequent recharging. Improved water and dust resistance would make it more durable for outdoor use, while a broader Bluetooth range would offer more flexibility in moving around without losing connection. Additionally, having multi-device pairing would make it easier to switch between different audio sources without disconnecting and reconnecting each time. Finally, integrating smart assistant support like Alexa or Google Assistant would make it more versatile for hands-free control and added functionality. These enhancements would elevate the overall experience and utility of the speaker.","Listening to music, Watching movies/TV shows, Video/audio calls (work/personal), Work stuff (e.g., webinars, online meetings)","Spending more time at home, Working from home more, More online social interactions",Less than $50,5.0,"Large multi-brand stores (e.g., Amazon)","When evaluating the price of a wireless speaker, I’d consider a balance between sound quality, battery life, and portability. Higher prices often reflect better sound output, longer battery life, and more compact or durable designs, especially for outdoor use. Connectivity features like Bluetooth range, multi-device pairing, or voice assistant integration can also affect the cost. Brand reputation, such as Bose or JBL, might come with a premium, but often assures quality and support. Additional features like waterproofing or extra functionalities may justify a higher price, and I’d also think about long-term value, considering whether spending more upfront will result in a speaker that lasts longer and better meets my needs.",18-24,Female,"Less than $25,000",no,0.0

2025-08-12 01:02:34.134,manaswi318@gmail.com,Yes,Once a week,Good,"My JBL speaker is both a wireless speaker and a karaoke speaker, which consists of two wireless microphones. The JBL speaker delivers clear, balanced audio with strong bass that’s impressive for its size. In addition, the vocals and microphone quality come through crisp, and the sound stays clean even at higher volumes. It works especially well for karaoke since the mic and music both remain distinct without distortion, and one can also tune out vocals and leave the background music for karaoke sessions as well as play around with the EQ systems to ensure music plays out according to their liking and preference.

I also compare it to similar speakers in the same range to see if it offers better value.",18-24,Female,"$75,000-$100,000","Beats by Dre products always stand out for their bold design and strong bass response. I’d love to see even more balanced sound tuning so vocals and mids are as crisp as the bass, especially for other musical genres.
