# Wireless Speakers Consumer Survey – Data Cleaning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing survey data on wireless speaker usage and consumer preferences. The dataset was originally collected through Google Forms and exported to Excel. The objective was to demonstrate data cleaning and organization practices that make the dataset ready for analysis and visualization.

## Cleaning Steps

The following steps were applied to the dataset:

1. Autofit columns and rows for readability.
2. Find and replace to standardize values.
3. Case standardization (lower, upper, and proper case where appropriate).
4. Trimmed extra spaces in text fields.
5. Removed duplicate responses.
6. Handled missing values by replacing categorical blanks with "N/A" and leaving open-text fields blank.
7. Error handling for numeric conversions and Likert scale responses.
8. Standardized numeric scales and spending ranges.
9. Preserved gridlines for clarity in Excel.
10. Applied professional formatting: bold headers, autofit columns, and freeze panes.
11. Final styling to make the dataset portfolio-ready.
