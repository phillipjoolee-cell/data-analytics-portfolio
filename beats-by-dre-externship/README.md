# Wireless Speaker Market Research – Beats by Dre

## Executive Summary
I analyzed survey data from 4,900+ respondents to help Beats decide whether to launch a new high-fidelity wireless speaker.  
The results point to a **GO** decision if:  
- Price stays between **$129–$199**  
- Battery life is **15 hours or more**  

Consumers trust Beats for sound and brand, but their buying decision mainly comes down to **price and battery life**. My recommendation: lean into sound quality and Apple ecosystem strengths while improving battery performance and sharpening pricing.


## What I Did
- Cleaned and organized the raw survey exports  
- Ran **quantitative analysis** (demographics, ownership, purchase intent, feature priorities, spending behavior)  
- Ran **qualitative analysis** (themes from open-ended responses)  
- Built exec-ready deliverables in Excel and as an interactive dashboard  

This project was less about code and more about showing my ability to analyze and present business data clearly.

## Workflow
1. **Cleaning** – structured the raw dataset, filtered incomplete responses, normalized demographics  
2. **Quantitative** – used Excel functions and pivot tables to break down demographics, intent, and feature importance  
3. **Qualitative** – grouped open-ended responses into themes (what people love vs. where Beats falls short)  
4. **Visualization** – built charts (bar, histogram, stacked columns, line) and dashboard-style layouts directly in Excel  

## Deliverables
- Excel workbooks: cleaned data, quantitative breakdowns, qualitative themes, and a combined “Complete Analysis” file  
- Executive presentation (PDF)  
- Interactive dashboard artifact for storytelling  

## Key Takeaways
- Market is mature: JBL dominates mid-range, Bose leads premium  
- Beats can compete by fixing **battery life** and positioning pricing smartly  
- Sweet spot is **$129–$179** — covers ~60% of buyers while protecting margins  
- Core audience: younger, brand-aware, price-sensitive consumers  

## Tools & Skills
This project was fully Excel:  
- Functions (`AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, `COUNTIF`, `IF`)  
- Pivot tables for slicing demographics and intent  
- Conditional formatting for quick visual cues  
- Charts and layouts for an executive-style dashboard
