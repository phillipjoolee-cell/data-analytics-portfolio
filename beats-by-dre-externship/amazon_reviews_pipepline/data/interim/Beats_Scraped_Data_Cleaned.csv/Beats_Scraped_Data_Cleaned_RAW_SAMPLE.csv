R1TIU27G892G8N,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best for modern music; fine for general purpose use,Glut & Lack: troublemaking twins,5,"Love this little speaker for the music I (and most of us) listen to. Extremely bass heavy, so it's great for the thumping stuff; not sure it would do well for classical music.Even with adjustment, it's a little muddy for voices (eg, audible books), but it does the job. If I'm gonna compromise, it'll be on that, not on music.So, I am entirely happy with it as an all-purpose speaker. It connects fast and reliably and has plenty range (past most people's normal listening distance).It's compact and robust. Very happy that its controls can be distinguished in the dark and be used without worries even when I'm wearing gloves or have damp, dirty hands.I got lucky with a Black Friday deal.Oh, and a lot of choices for cases exist. I wanted a stash case - not while-in-use - with full protection. The clamshell cases are cute, and some are offered in (possibly) matching colors. But I didn't want to fiddle with a long stitched hinge and a cornered zipper (both presenting stress points) so I kept looking and found a cylindrical case with a top that zips open. It fits the FLIP 6 perfectly.Worpie Carrying Travel Case for Flip 6 Flip 5 Flip 4 Flip 3 Portable Speakerhttps://a.co/d/abH8lV3","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2025",AEMU5GYR7E7YH5B64AKBUNZ5Y4PA,1,19,"Color: Blue, Style: Flip 6"

This speaker delivers powerful sound with deep bass that fills the room, making it perfect for any occasion. Whether I'm using it at home, outdoors, or while traveling, the sound quality remains impressive.The IPX7 waterproof feature is a game-changer. I’ve taken it to the beach and even used it by the pool without worrying about splashes or rain. It's incredibly durable and can handle any environment, which is perfect for outdoor adventures.The 12 hours of playtime is another standout feature. Whether it's a long day at the park or a road trip, I never have to worry about charging it constantly. And when I want to take things up a notch, JBL PartyBoost lets me pair it with other JBL speakers for an even bigger sound experience—ideal for parties and get-togethers.The Teal color is a sleek and modern touch, and it’s a compact size, making it easy to carry around without sacrificing performance.

R8ZPP4M7T18BO,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars The Sound Is Great,Michelle,5,"I'm so glad I bought this. I use it daily I have other Bluetooth speakers but they can't home a candle light to this JBL. The sound quality is awesome it blows away my sound bar & its water proof. I got it for a great price,but if I had to replace it I'd definitely pay the full price. It connects easily to my Samsung phone you can take it just about anywhere. I've dropped if a couple if times but if didn't hurt it one bit, very durable. If has great range. It fits great in my shower","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2025",AHHSFRGEAFWTV24U7MFCK7V54P7Q,1,1,"Color: Blue, Style: Flip 6"

RF4X9MUCFL4QZ,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Not too small Not too big,Nikki Fox,5,"These are not huge, but great for my sports players who transport them to the fields and back. Still very loud and durable just easier to transport. Clarity and connectivity is still JBL quality.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2025",AEP7HYGSBZ5Q2DII5UM2CWYXUQUA,1,1,"Color: Blue, Style: Flip 6"
