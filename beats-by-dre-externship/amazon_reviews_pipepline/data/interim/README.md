# Interim Data

This folder contains partially processed datasets — cleaned but not fully finalized. They’re useful for tracking transformations step by step.
- Beats_Scraped_Data_Cleaned.xlsx – structured review data with duplicates removed, demographics normalized, and a cleaning log + data dictionary.
- Beats_Scraped_Data_NumPy_Prepped.xlsx – dataset staged for NumPy analysis and matrix operations.
- Beats_Scraped_Data_Pandas_EDA.xlsx – exploratory analysis results from pandas (summaries, distributions).

## Connection
These files sit in the middle; they show my cleaning and prep work before pushing the data into the final processed outputs.
