# Beats by Dre Market Research – Externship Project  

This repo brings together two connected projects I built during my Beats by Dre externship.  
Both explore whether Beats should launch a new high-fidelity wireless speaker, but from different angles.  

- **Amazon Reviews Pipeline**: scraped and analyzed Amazon reviews for Beats and four competitors.  
  - Focus: Python, pandas, NumPy, TextBlob, Seaborn/Matplotlib, Gemini AI.  
  - Output: cleaned datasets, sentiment analysis, visualizations, and AI-driven customer themes.  

- **Survey Pipeline**: analyzed 4,900+ survey responses to understand market demand and feature priorities.  
  - Focus: Excel (functions, pivot tables, conditional formatting) and dashboard building.  
  - Output: quantitative and qualitative analysis workbooks, executive PDF, and interactive dashboard.  

## Why It Matters  
Together, these projects show both sides of my skillset:  

- **Technical**: building reproducible pipelines, cleaning messy raw data, and applying Python/AI for insights.  
- **Analytical**: translating survey data into clear recommendations and decision-ready deliverables.  

## Repo Structure  
- `amazon_reviews_pipeline/` – scraping, cleaning, EDA, visualizations, and analysis of Amazon reviews.  
- `survey_pipeline/` – survey analysis and executive deliverables.
