# Raw Data
This folder holds the original scraped exports from Amazon reviews. These are untouched and kept for reference only.

- Source: Amazon review exports (JSON/CSV)
- Use: Input for cleaning and pipeline scripts

Note: Files are messy â€” duplicates, nulls, and inconsistent formats are expected.

## Connection
This is the starting point; everything else in the pipeline builds off these raw files.
