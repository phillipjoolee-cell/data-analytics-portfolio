# Data  

This folder contains the survey data used for the analysis.  

- raw/: the original survey exports, including the full dataset (4,900+ responses) and smaller samples.  
- cleaned/: filtered and structured versions with incomplete responses removed and demographics normalized.  

## Connection:
The cleaned survey data is the starting point for both the quantitative and qualitative analysis.
